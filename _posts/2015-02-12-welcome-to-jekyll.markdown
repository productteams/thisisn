What is a Digital Concierge?
Just like a normal concierge, who’s role it is to do things for you – run an errand, buy theatre tickets, make dinner reservations, whatever it is you need, a Digital Concierge does the same but works via text or messenger and uses digital technology to streamline the process. More importantly, the Digital Concierge learns from every interaction.  There is a human concierge whose efforts are maximized by using digital tools. You tell us what you need to be completed and we do it for you.  You get what you need when you need it, and the next time you need something, it is easier and faster.
